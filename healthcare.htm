<p>Healthcare is necessary for everyone, but many poor people don't have access to it. Even though many life-threatening diseases have been eradicated, there are still many people who don't have sanitary conditions and often get sick. Even in countries where healthcare is easily accessible, it is often very expensive and people are left with a lot of debt after being treated. We need to get rid of dangerous diseases that still exist and focus on treating people who can't receive treatment very easily. People shouldn't have to lose a lot of money just to be treated for diseases.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest problems with healthcare today:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Inefficient data</b> - Doctors don't have all the necessary data for a diagnosis. Since the same data is used by many hospitals, patients don't have their data and the same data is in many different formats.</li>
<li><b>Very short visits</b> - The average doctor's appointment lasts only 7 to 12 minutes, and during that time, there is very little eye contact, causing diagnostic errors. The doctor has to think of the diagnosis quickly.</li>
<li><b>Unnecessary lab tests</b> - These are ordered too often, causing less time to examine the patient's story and data.</li>
<li><b>Doctors have too many appointments</b> - They feel stressed out, preventing them from properly carrying out their jobs. This also leads to more medical errors.</li>
</ul>
