<p>The global demand for food has been increasing steadily for 20 years, even though food production was also increasing. Around 15 years ago, food stocks became depleted after a series of extreme weather conditions. Then, oil prices quickly increased, which also increased the cost of food production and fertilizer. Many countries tried to find ways to prevent food shortages and price shocks. Some countries imposed export restrictions and some importers purchased food at any price to keep a normal supply of food.</p>
<p>Here are some facts about the states of food security and nutrition in the world from fao.org:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 820 million people don't have enough to eat.</li>
<li>Many countries have problems with overweight and obese people.</li>
<li>Ending hunger and malnutrition by 2020 is one of the biggest challenges.</li>
<li>The percent of people who are malnourished is 11%, which has been about the same for several years.</li>
<li>17.2 percent of the world population, or 1.3 billion people, have experienced food insecurity at moderate levels.</li>
<li>The hunger situation has been the most alarming in Africa, where the percent of malnourished people has been steadily increasing.</li>
</ul>
