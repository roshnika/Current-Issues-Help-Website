<h2>Climate Change</h2>
<img src="https://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/103_shutterstock_88550854-740px.jpg" alt="Climate change">
<p>Climate change is one of the most dangerous problems today and it affects nearly everyone. There is a higher possibility	of unusual weather patterns, causing many industries to be affected. For example, farmers cannot grow the same crops they used to grow because weather conditions are now different in their area.</p>
<p>If we don't take action as soon as possible, adapting to these changes will be very hard and expensive and everyone's lives will be strongly affected.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if we all work together, even small changes in our lifestyles can save the environment.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to help the environment in your daily lives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recycle if possible.</li>
<li>Use renewable materials instead of plastic.</li>
<li>Use items multiple times instead of throwing them away.</li>
<li>Turn off the lights and water when you are not using them.</li>
<li>Don't waste food.</li>
<li>Use public transport or carpool.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pollution</h2>
<img src="https://assets.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_content--retina/public/media-uploads/health4_26_airpollguide_istock_2796602_2400.jpg?itok=n2tBYa7S" alt="Pollution">
<p>When harmful materials are released into the environment, many issues can occur. This can be caused by natural phenomena, but nowadays, it is usually caused by things we consider useful. For example, cars and industries release smoke into the air and our garbage can get into the land and water. All living species depend on these resources. When they are polluted, everyone is hurt. Even if there is pollution in only one small area, it can eventually spread and impact a large portion of the world.</p>
<p>Since pollution is one of the causes of climate change, the ways to prevent climate change mentioned above can also prevent pollution.</p>
<p>Make sure to discard waste properly and don't overuse anything that releases chemicals into the air.</p>
