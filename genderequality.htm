<p>Achieving women's rights is one of the toughest problems to solve. Women and girls make up half of the population and they need to be represented. There is still a long way to go to achieve equality. We need to make sure women still have the same services as men and have equal opportunities. Women still earn less than men for the same jobs and there is still gender violence. We need to end inequality and make sure everyone can live the same lives.</p>
<p>Here are some facts from unwomen.org:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though 143 out of 195 countries guarantee gender equality in their constitutions, women are still subject to gender stereotypes, corrupt laws, and social norms and practices.</li>
<li>There is discrimination in jobs, so women can't apply for some jobs.</li>
<li>Women face discrimination in many forms, not just gender.</li>
<li>Husbands are the heads of their families in 29 countries.</li>
<li>Women can't change their nationality in more than 60 countries.</li>
<li>Women are more likely to lack basic literacy skills than men.</li>
<li>1 out of 3 women have experienced sexual violence.</li>
<li>133 million girls and women have had genital mutilation.</li>
<li>Only 22% of parliamentary seats are occupied by women.</li>
</ul>
<p>Women still struggle a lot in their lives and there needs to be a solution to this.</p>
<p>Men also need to be part of this movement and help their peers.</p>
